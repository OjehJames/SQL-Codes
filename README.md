# Data Analytics Interview Question solved.

The challenge here was to write ✍🏽 SQL query that would query the database to join 4 tables provided by interviewer and return already specified columns back. The tricky thing here is that only the first five columns have been created in the provided tables, the rest we have to create them using calculations and performing data aggregation…

For this task I used Big query as my database, I created a new dataset in big query, titled ‘sql_practice1’ & uploaded the provided 4 tables into the dataset. The tables are in .csv format.

In this repository you will find 

1. The four tables in .csv formate: correct_answer.csv, question_paper_code.csv, student_list.csv and student_response.csv

2. The interview question: Input_Output - Problem Statement.docx

3. My solution : Challenge_Solved.sql
